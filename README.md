# TraitRELAX
A method for association of changes in phenotype traits with changes in selection intensity at the codon level across a phylogeny

The method is develoed in Bio++ and can be used by installing the libraries from the below repositories:

* https://github.com/halabikeren/bpp-core
* https://github.com/halabikeren/bpp-seq
* https://github.com/halabikeren/bpp-phyl
* https://github.com/halabikeren/bpp-popgen
* https://github.com/halabikeren/bppsuite

According to the instructions [here](http://biopp.univ-montp2.fr/wiki/index.php/Installation).

To execute TraitRELAX:
* Build a parameter file according to the template TraitRELAX_template.bpp
* From your installation directory, run: ./bppsuite/bppSuite/traitrelax param=<full_path_to_your_parameters_file>
